## Abstract
Bug reports vary in detail, with some providing extensive information while others are too brief to be fully informative. Duplicate bug reports can serve as a valuable resource to enrich bug descriptions, yet most existing summarization techniques focus on individual reports only.

This paper investigates methods for summarizing duplicate bug reports. By aggregating information across multiple reports, various text summarization techniques were applied and compared to generate more informative summaries. Results indicate that an extractive, TF‑IDF‑based multi-document summarization approach is the most effective, successfully capturing relevant information while reducing redundancy across reports.

The findings contribute to the development of bug summarization techniques and highlight the value of leveraging duplicate bug reports for creating concise, informative summaries.
